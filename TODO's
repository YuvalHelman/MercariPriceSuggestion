We assume that the embeddings will do the work for the descriptions.

Algorithms we want to try:
1. SVM (with GridSearch).
2. PCA with SVM
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost/Catbosot
5. Neural networks

After this one we will try the same things without the description at all (dropping the column).
This will allow us to check the effectivity of the embeddings.

Tasks:
Yuval - finish the embeddings + Random Forest + XGboost (without the embeddings)
Jakov - 1. + 2. without the columns of the item description (there is more than one column).
