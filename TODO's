We assume that the embeddings will do the work for the descriptions.

Algorithms we want to try:
1. SVM (with GridSearch).  --> Not a thing here.. need to work with Regression linear model
2. PCA
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost/Catboost
5. Neural networks 
 - (should use an output layer for regression (use several loss functions))
 - Use different number of layers and different number of neurons. (Try using grid-search)
 6. RNN mabye

After this one we will try the same things without the description at all (dropping the column).
This will allow us to check the effectivity of the embeddings.

- After doing a network -> try using PCA for several dimensions and see how good it does.

Tasks:
Yuval - finish the embeddings + Random Forest + XGboost (without the embeddings)
Jakov - 1. + 2. without the columns of the item description (there is more than one column).


at the end we will write the categories that the algorithm knew how to predict better and thoes that he didnt worse.
