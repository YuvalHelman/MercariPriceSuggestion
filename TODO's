We assume that the embeddings will do the work for the descriptions.

Algorithms left to do:
1. Regression linear model
4. XGBoost/Catboost (Just run on a lot of data
5. Neural networks - Try different builds

After this one we will try the same things without the description at all (dropping the column).
This will allow us to check the effectivity of the embeddings.
